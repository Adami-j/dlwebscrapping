# script-test-url

#The purpose of this application is to download files from a website called "Wawacity" using the "AllDebrid" service. The application allows the user to specify the Wawacity site URL, the AllDebrid API key, and the desired hosting service name (e.g., Uptobox, Turbobit, etc.). The application then scrapes the download links from the Wawacity site, unlocks them with AllDebrid, and saves them to a text file. The user can also load previously saved links from the text file and download the corresponding files. The application also allows the user to select a download folder to save the downloaded files. Additionally, the application clears the content of the text file upon closing.
